# Building A CS Résumé

## It's not too early...

Note:

This list began with slides from a talk by Patrick of Microsoft Research aimed at helping college professors understand how to help their students prepare to launch their careers. The advice is equally good for targeting internships or college interviews.

Find something that you are passionate about, or at least that you are curious enough about to dive into. The work will be more fun and your interest and passion will come through in your work and the way you present it in interviews. Excitement about a project and commitment to the field are persuasive and compelling.

## Career Pathways In CS

* "I can do that"
* Certifications
* Military
* 2-year Programs
* 4-year Programs

Note:

The field is still very much a meritocracy and there is a shortage of people - this works to your advantage.

## Create A Professional Online Profile

* [GitHub][]
  - School projects
  - Practice problems, experiments, personal projects
* Work on open source projects
  - Contributions will show up on your GitHub profile
* [LinkedIn][]

[github]: <https://github.com>
[linkedin]: <https://linkedin.com>

Note:

* LinkedIn
* GitHub
  - School projects
  - Practice problems, experiments, personal projects
* Work on open source projects
  - Contributions will show up on your GitHub profile
  - Ways to get started:
    - Fix typos in documentation
    - Improve tutorials and examples (**you** are the audience)
    - Tackle projects/bugs from the issues list
    - Check out beginner mentoring (e.g. Drupal office hours)
* Create an online portfolio of design work
* Connect your GitHub and LinkedIn profiles, and your portfolio to your (online) résumé.

## Get Some Experience

* Internships
* Using tech skills in a "non-tech" job
* No job or internship?
  - Work on open source software projects
  - Work on public coding challenges
    - Keep the code on GitHub
  - Volunteer to do tech work for a non-profit:
    - Create/maintain a web site
    - Automate boring/repetitive tasks

Note:

Starting out "experience" is anything that shows that you have *some* "industrial strength" technical skills (Game Lab: not so much; JavaScript: maybe; JavaScript that you know how to deploy "in the wild:" yes; deployable JavaScript with tests in a repo on GitHub: absolutely) and some core "soft skills:"
* Being on time
* Communicationg with co-workers and management
* Responding well to feedback

* Go for tech internships!
  - Add them to your résumé
* Look for opportunities to apply your tech skills in a "non-tech" job - TAing? create a website for the class.
  - Add them to your résumé.
* If you can't put your tech skills to work at a job or internship:
  - Work on open source software projects (see above)
  - Work on public coding challenges
    - Keep the code on GitHub
  - Volunteer to do tech work for a non-profit:
    - Create/maintain a web site
    - Automate boring/repetitive tasks
    - Build tools to organize and/or analyize data
    - Add to your resume and GitHub
* Know the differences and benefits of functional résumés
* The energy that you put into launching your career will be matched by your teachers, managers, and mentors.
