# College and University CS Programs

## General

Research (R1) vs. teaching schools. Both have their place, but there is a big impact on the "fit" for students.

## In-State (Washington) Schools

### [Bellevue College](https://www.bellevuecollege.edu/cs), Bellevue, WA

Small program, right now acceptance into BC is pretty much a guarantee of admission to the major.

Degrees:
* BS in CS
* BAS in Data Analytics
* BAS in Information Systems & Technology

### [CWU](https://cwu.edu), Ellensburg, WA

Teaching university.

**Programs:**
* [Computer Science](https://cwu.edu/computer-science)
* [STEM Teaching Program Minor](https://cwu.edu/teachstem)

### [EWU](https://www.ewu.edu), Cheney, WA

Second largest program (# of graduates) in the state. Teaching university, lots of ethnic diversity in the program. Focus on hands on learning and supporting opportunities for internships (students take lead). Accepts (and succussfully trains and graduates) students with GPAs in the 3+ range. Good option for students who might not make it into the UW program.

**Programs:**
* [BS in Computer Science](https://www.ewu.edu/compsci)
* [Bachelor of Computer Science]()
* [3D Animation]()
* [Computer Applications Minor]()
* [Computer Information Systems Minor]()
* [Computer Science Programming Minor]()
* [Web Application Development Minor]()
