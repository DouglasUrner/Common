# College and University CS Programs

## General

Research (R1) vs. teaching schools. Both have their place, but there is a big impact on the "fit" for students.

## In-State (Washington) Schools

### [Bellevue College](https://www.bellevuecollege.edu/cs), Bellevue, WA

Small program, right now acceptance into BC is pretty much a guarantee of admission to the major.

Degrees:
* BS in CS
* BAS in Data Analytics
* BAS in Information Systems & Technology

### [CWU](https://cwu.edu), Ellensburg, WA

Teaching university.

**Programs:**
* [Computer Science](https://cwu.edu/computer-science)
* [STEM Teaching Program Minor](https://cwu.edu/teachstem)

### [EWU](https://www.ewu.edu), Cheney, WA

Second largest program (# of graduates) in the state. Teaching university, lots of ethnic diversity in the program. Focus on hands on learning and supporting opportunities for internships (students take lead). Accepts (and succussfully trains and graduates) students with GPAs in the 3+ range. Good option for students who might not make it into the UW program.

**Programs:**
* [BS in Computer Science](https://www.ewu.edu/compsci)
* [Bachelor of Computer Science]()
* [3D Animation]()
* [Computer Applications Minor]()
* [Computer Information Systems Minor]()
* [Computer Science Programming Minor]()
* [Web Application Development Minor]()

### [Green River College](https://greenriver.edu) - Auburn, WA


### [PLU](https://www.plu.edu/computer-science/) - Tacoma, WA

About 200, 6 CS faculty. Admission to school ensures admission to major.

BA in CS
BS in CS

### [Seattle University]() - Seattle, WA

### [University of Washington (UW)](https://uw.edu) - Seattle, WA

[Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering](https://cs.uw.edu) - The CS program gets *way* more applicants than they can accept. Apply for [direct admission](https://www.cs.washington.edu/academics/ugrad/admissions/direct) so that you know you will be able to study CS at UW, if you get in to the UW, but are not accepted into the CS program as a freshman, you can still apply when you declare your major - but you may not be acceted. *So* if you are serious about CS, apply for direct admission and if you are not accepted, seriously consider a different school.

### [Harvey Mudd College](https://www.hmc.edu) - Claremont, CA

Harvey Mudd College (HMC) is a small (800 students) liberal arts school which the Business Insider describes as "[an engineering, science, and mathematics powerhouse](https://www.businessinsider.com/harvey-mudd-college-curriculum-computer-science-2017-3)." US News & World report ranks HMC as the number one engineering school in the country.

Harvey Mudd requires all students to take an introductory CS course, and according to the LA Times, this a led to [gender parity in the CS department](https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-harvey-mudd-tech-women-adv-snap-story.html).
