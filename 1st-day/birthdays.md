# Birthdays

During [Lines & Blobs](activities/lines-and-blobs.md) have your students arrange themselves by birthday (month and day). This can also be used to "randomize" a seating chart.

There is a relatively high liklihood of birthday "collisions," in a class of:

| # | P |
| ---: | ---: |
| 15 | 0.2500 |
| 20 | 0.4058 |
| 25 | 0.5604 |
| 30 | 0.6963 |
| 31 | 0.7203 |

This activity can be a nice introduction to the [Birthday Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem) and also to:

* Assumptions
  - "It's all about me."
  - Linearity
* Stats
* Hashing functions
  - Birthday is hash function
  - Seating chart is a set of bins
  - Collisions happen when there is a shared birthday
* Cryptographic methods
  - [Birthday attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_attack)
* Problem solving
  - What do you do when there is a collision?
