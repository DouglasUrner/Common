# Birthdays

During [Lines & Blobs](activities/lines-and-blobs.md) have your students arrange themselves by birthday (month and day). This can also be used to "randomize" a seating chart.

There is a relatively high liklihood of birthday "collisions," in a class of:

| # | P |
| ---: | ---: |
| 15 |  |
| 20 |  |
| 25 |  |
| 30 |  |
| 31 |  |
