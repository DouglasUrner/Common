## First Weeks Of Semester

### 0: Overview

Full semester project to update resume with knowledge (both domain knowledge and knowledge of employment opportunities) and skills from this class - and your other classes this semester.

The resume and cover letter components are expected to be peer edited to a *very* high standard - spelling, grammer, punctuation, and consistancy.

The assignments in this unit are differentiated based on:
* Grade level
* Classes the student has taken or is taking on the pathway
* Where the student is in their math classes
* World language classes (e.g., ELL, ability to take on translation projects, interest in other cultures and translation processes)

### 1: Objective & Strengths

Do in the first couple of days of the semester - this lesson provides information on where the students are starting and is also a "get to know you" exercise.

### 2: Connections

The course objectives are introduced and students explore how the course supports and complements their goals. Students are also asked to make connections between their other classes and their objectives and the objectives of this class.

This lesson is a tie in to the High School & Beyond Plan and work in Xello (identify specific components of the HS&BP that connect with the resume assignment).

## Mid Second Quarter

### 3: Experience Opportunities

Identify potentially interesting open source projects that you could contribute to to build experience - both for actual work experience and to help build your resume.

Could also come after the resume update.

## End of Semester

### 4: Resume Update

Add skills from this semester's classes to resume - self-assessment of growth as measured by the essential tasks of the course (and related essential tasks from other classes). The resume update / self-assessment is an opportunity to do a defense of learning and reassessment for the semester.

Meticulous proof reading.

### 5: Cover Letter

Create a generic cover letter that can be used as a jumping off point for job specific cover letters.
