## Saving Your Work On Code.org Websites

If you are graduating or leaving the district and want to retain access to the work you've done on a Code.org website (e.g., Game Lab, App Lab, etc.) you will need to add a personal login to your student account. To do that, follow [these instructions](https://support.code.org/hc/en-us/articles/115001475131-Adding-a-personal-login-to-a-student-account) from Code.org.
