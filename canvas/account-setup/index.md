## Canvas Account Setup

By this point you have a Canvas account and have joined the class. What's left is to clean up your Canvas account settings to display your name properly and to make sure that you are shown the due dates in our timezone. You should also create a bookmark to the class in Chrome.

[Slides][slides] - right-click and choose **Open link in a new tab** to view.

### Learning Targets:

* I can edit my account settings.
* I can create a bookmark in Chrome.
* I can mark a required assignment as "done" in Canvas.

## Instructions

Follow along in the [slides][slides] to:

1. **Edit your Canvas account settings:**
   - **Full Name:** enter the name by which Skyward knows you.
   - **Display Name:** the name you call yourself.
   - **Sortable Name:** make sure that it got your last name right, Canvas does okay with single word last names, but always gets unhyphenated multi-word lastnames wrong. It should read ***your last name, your first name*** – for example ***Urner, Douglas***.
   - **Time Zone:** make sure it is set to Pacific.
   - Please be sure that your name is capitalized "correctly" - then click **Update Settings** to save your work.
1. **Create a bookmark in Chrome for our class.**
1. **Mark the assignment as done.**

## Submission

For this assignment you do not need to submit anything - all you need to do is to click the **Mark as done** button in the upper right corner of the page. You won't be able to move on in the unit until you mark the assignment as done. I'll be able to tell if you completed it correctly when I check the class roster in Canvas. Not making the bookmark is a self-punishing crime…
