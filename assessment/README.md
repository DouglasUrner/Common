# Assessment

The assessment categories are the six core computing practices that define our essential tasks:

* **Analyzing** the **effects** of developments in computing ([AE][])
* **Designing and implementing** creative solutions and artifacts ([DI][]])
* **Applying abstractions** and models ([AA][]])
* **Analyzing** their computational **work** and the work of others ([AW][])
* **Communicating** computational thought processes, procedures, and **results** to others ([CR][]])
* **Collaborating with peers** on computing activities ([CP][])
