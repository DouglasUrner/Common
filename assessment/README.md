# Assessment

The assessment categories are the six core computing practices that define our essential tasks:

* **Analyzing** the **effects** of developments in computing ([AE][])
* **Designing and implementing** creative solutions and artifacts ([DI][]])
* **Applying abstractions** and models ([AA][]])
* **Analyzing** their computational **work** and the work of others ([AW][])
* **Communicating** computational thought processes, procedures, and **results** to others ([CR][]])
* **Collaborating with peers** on computing activities ([CP][])

## Letter Grades

**A:**

**B:** a solid foundation has emerged, further work can be built on the foundation.

**C:** a basic understanding of the field has emerged, but it is not strong foundation for further work.

**D:** the knowledge, skills, and understading developed are unlikely to be sufficient to support further work without remediation â€“ there is evidence of effort and progress towards mastery of the essential tasks.

**F:** there is little or no evidence of progress towards mastery of the essential tasks.
