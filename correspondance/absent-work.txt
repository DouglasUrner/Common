All of our class assignments are on Canvas (https://canvas.insturcture.com) – signing in from home works just like signing in at school. All you have to do is click on the Google button (the G) under the username/password fields on the login page. Just be sure to sign out of a personal Google account before attempting to sign in.

Please let me know if you have any problems accessing Canvas, I’m happy to help troubleshoot.
