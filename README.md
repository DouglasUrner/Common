# Common

Shared Lessons - mostly notebooks, Canvas, Git/GitHub, and working with Google Docs.

Each topic (e.g., Git-and-GitHub) and each lesson within it is a submodule. They are setup to track the **master** branch. This repository serves primarily to organize the lessons and hopefully makes them work well with GitHub Classroom. To update the submodules:

```bash
# Everything
git submodule update --remote
# One lesson
cd path/to/lesson
git submodule update --remote
```

To start a new submodule:

```bash
```

To add an existing lesson as a submodule:

```bash
```
