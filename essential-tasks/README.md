# Essential Tasks

The "big" essential tasks taught across the CS pathway, with the rationale and introductory material for each.

The tasks themselves are derived from the work done by the developers of the [Exploring Computer Science (ECS)][ecs] curriculum identifying six "computing practices:"

* **Analyzing** the **effects** of developments in computing ([AE][])
* **Designing and implementing** creative solutions and artifacts (DI)
* **Applying abstractions** and models (AA)
* **Analyzing** their computational **work** and the work of others (AW)
* **Communicating** computational thought processes, procedures, and **results** to others (CR)
* **Collaborating with peers** on computing activities ([CP][])
