Work and school are places that people have to be. Options are limited to encourage productive and focused work environments. "Hostile work environments" are firmly discouraged by most companies, and in some cases by law. "Free speach" rights exist vis-a-vis the government, employers have much greater latitude to constrain speach and behavior. In general "your right to swing your arms ends at my nose" is a good way to think about the bounds of reasonable behavior.

Specific problem areas:
* Guns/violence
* Sexism, orientation and gender identity phobias
* Racism and negative sterotyping
* Non work-related pressuring

People need to work (learn at school) - so, somebody who makes you uncomfortable because of who they are: e.g., race, nationality, gender identity, religion, etc, but who does not bring that into work in a disruptive way is likely to have their right/need to work/learn outweigh your discomfort. Actions on either side that disrupt the working/learning environment are another matter. Non-governmental organizations have much greater latitude to extend protections.
