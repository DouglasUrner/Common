# CP: **Collaborating with peers** on computing activities

  ***Collaboration:*** Working with others to solve a acheive a goal. This includes the interpersonal skills, the processes, and the tools to communicate amoungst the stakeholders and track the work.

***Peers:*** The people on your team ***and*** the people that you interact with as you work.

In 21st Century Skills terms this is state as "working with diverse teams." There should be no doubt that most work is done by teams, teams that benefit from diversity, and that working well in a team is a skill to be developed (and thus to be assessed).

There should be no denying or glossing over the existance of conflicting interests on the world, or local, stage – nor should we pretend that the challenges presented by conflict can be solved by isolation or force. Many conflicts are the result of mis-understandings and sterotyping and are solved by understanding and agreement and integrity in the execution of the agreements. In the worst cases conflict is driven by pathology and understanding the nature of the parties provides the basis for setting boundaries and developing defensive strategies.

## Why Collaboration Is Important
* Many real-world projects are too big to be undertaken alone.
* A single point of view is often insufficient for understanding and solving a problem.
* The range of processes and expertise required by many projects exceeds what a single person or team can do.

## Why Working In Diverse Teams Is Important
* People are "diverse by nature" – the range of experience and perspective, even in a "homegeneous" community is often very large.
* As individuals we are often limited in our perspectives, diverse teams natually bring in a wider range of views and experinces that increases the quality and useability of our products.
