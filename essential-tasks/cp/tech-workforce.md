[USA Today reported][stem-jobs-unfilled] that the US had 600,000 *unfilled* STEM jobs in 2017, in 2016 only 568 thousand STEM graduates entered the workforce. In China and India the top 10% of STEM graduates outnumber *all* STEM graduates in the US. There are two obvious conclusions of this:

1. Jobs will have to go where the people are, or
2. STEM workers trained outside of the US will be recruited by US companies to come and work here.

Either way, STEM workers and managers in the US will find themselves working with increasingly diverse teams.
